# Beta Ride Taxi Service - Power BI Capstone Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes operational and revenue data from Beta Ride, a taxi service, to uncover insights that can help improve service delivery, optimize resource allocation, and boost revenue generation. The analysis focuses on trip demand patterns, driver performance, payment methods, and external conditions such as weather and time of day.

## Data Source:
The analysis uses a cleaned and prepared dataset from Bete-Ride Taxi services through @mydataclique (A data community) and it contains the following key fields:
trip_id, date, day_of_week, month,
trip_distance, total_amount,
payment_type, weather_condition, driver_id, trip_purpose

## Tool Used
- Power BI, Power Query

## Data Cleaning and Preparation Process
- Using Power Query, the following transformations were applied:
- Extracted Month, Day, Hour from trip timestamps
- Created custom sorting columns for day and month
- Categorized trip time into Morning Peak, Evening Peak, and Off-Peak
- Calculated total revenue, average trip distance, and MoM growth

## Goal of the Analysis
Beta Ride wants to:
Identify trends in revenue and growth
Understand customer demand and trip patterns
Analyze the impact of traffic and weather on rides
Optimize their operations for better efficiency and profits
